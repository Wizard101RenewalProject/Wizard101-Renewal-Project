FAQ: 

What is this mod? - The Wizard101 Renewal Project is mod that restores the vast majority of the original textures (upscaled 4x) from arc 1, the sound effects, music, animations, models, and other small items to bring the game/vibe back to the most original version possible. Many of the assets are the original ones from 2008 while others are from around 2010. The reason the mods sticks to arc 1 is simply because Celestia through Khrysalis remains mostly the same from an client side perspective. THIS MOD IS NOT A PRIVATE SERVER! YOU MUST HOLD A WIZARD101 ACCOUNT TO PLAY. THIS MOD EFFECTS ONLY YOUR PC, EVERYTHING IS CLIENT SIDE. 

Can I be banned for using this? - Yes, technically speaking of course. I have been playing with a modded client for almost a year now without any issues, but PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACCOUNT BEING SUSPENDED! YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MOD IS AGAINST TOS

Why? - Over the years, I have felt that Wizard101 has lost the original vibe it original had, even while only questing in arc 1. Many of the spells have had their sounds change, the music was removed, the player models altered and uncanny, and in some places I feel even the art style has changed, namely in Wizard City. So, while I won't be creating a private server, this mod will serve as the closest thing currently possible to experiencing most of original Wizard101.

Why restore old textures just to upscale them? - I want the original art style without the terrible texture resolution. Upscaling the textures, specifically in Wizard City, breathes new life into the original zones, that way the original graphics aren't jarring with horrible resolution.

Why not just use classic mode? -  I could probably make a 5 hour video on why classic mode sucks. But to put of briefly, its just not a classic mode. I don't think most people, including the devs, realize how much has changed since the old days. All classic mode gives you is the original music for ravenwood, commons and old town, and the graphics for wizard city. That's its. No spells, dialogue, models, animations, or even the intro and battle music. Kingsisle claims that less than 1% of players use the classic mode, but maybe that's BECAUSE IT SUCKS

Why has  (Insert my favorite thing) not been restored? - Probably because I either don't have the original file, forgot, or just don't have the expertise, or its impossible. I wish I could restore all the spell animations, but some of them, such as forest lord, are too long for the server. The cinematics would have to be shortened somehow in 3d animation software, which I don't have enough experience in. Same with menus and UI, I simply don't have knowledge in c++ or other languages to write new scripting to for an original looking UI with all the current features.

HOW TO INSTALL:
DO NOT USE THE WIZARD101 LAUNCHER TO START THE GAME!
1. Download Milklauncher and follow the instructions in the Readme file to "force a full game redownload". Enter your username and password, click "add account", select your account, then hit launch. Remember not to check any boxes on the launcher initially. If you see loading icons in game, you did not do this correctly. If Milklauncher gets stuck, end the task and restart, try not to tab into another app. Stay on Milklauncher
2. Download this Mod
3. Open the mod file, copy and paste all .WAD files into C:\ProgramData\KingsIsle Entertainment\Wizard101\Data\GameData (use your own install path to "\Kingsisle Entertainment" if different) Overwrite all files pasted
4. Return to Milklauncher, check "Skip Patching"
5. Click "Launch" again and enjoy Wizard101 Renewal!
If the game gives an error upon launching, make sure you are not running in full screen. Open the wizard101 launcher, settings, then changed to windowed or borderless. Play with graphics settings if you do not like launching the game in windowed every time. 


KNOWN ISSUES: 
I'm not gonna list off issues like some kind of patch notes. I made this mod for arc 1 specifically. I have questing through the entirety myself, so it should be mostly good, but some models may have been edited in a "bad" way. If you see any mobs  or things glitching out/T-posing in newer zones, this is probably why. Just leave a post on the mod and I'll get it fixed.


DUE TO THE NATURE OF A CONSTANTLY UPDATING GAME, THE MOD WILL BREAK AT SOME POINT. THE MOD FILES WILL NEED TO BE REPACKAGED WITH THE UPDATED VERSION. IF YOUR GAME STOPS WORKING, DELETE THE "ROOT.WAD" FILE AND UNCHECK "SKIP PATCHING"  TO REDOWNLOAD WITH MILKLAUNCHER SO YOU CAN AT LEAST LOG IN. I WILL EVENTUALLY CREATE A NEW, WORKING VERSION OF THE BROKEN FILES AND UPDATE THEM HERE
